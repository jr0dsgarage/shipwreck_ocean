# Shipwreck Ocean Biome Datapack

A 1.18.2+ biome datapack that has more shipwrecks
(...hopefully - i currently can't seem to change spawn density, so it might be a bust)

Currently only generates the minecraft:shipwreck_ocean biome - a straight copy of the original ocean biome, with a few color parameters changed for easy visibility in-game.

The goal is a [Bermuda Triangle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bermuda_Triangle) vibe âš“
